# Rolodex
A digital rolodex python app for processing images/PDFs of business cards. Useful on its own or for preparing a CSV to import contacts to another application (e.g. Outlook).

Executable: Located at \PyInstaller\dist\rolodex\rolodex_v1.0.exe

Future improvements:
- Eliminate warnings related to font size initialization
- Improve heuristic parsing of business card images/text
- Reduce launch time (currently ~10 to 20 seconds)
